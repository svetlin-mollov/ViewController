# ViewController
A lightweight controller for Android Views. Suitable for the V in MV* architectural patterns.
It is not meant to be a replacement for the Android's Fragments, but rather break down the UI into
smaller pieces, which have simple lifecycle and better performance than using lots of fragments.
